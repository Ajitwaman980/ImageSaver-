This code snippet is a part of a Node.js application using Express.js for routing and Passport.js for authentication. It handles various routes related to user authentication, profile management, and image uploads. Here's a concise summary of its functionality:

Setup and Middleware:
Imports necessary modules including Express, Passport, a user model, and Multer for handling file uploads.
Configures Passport to use a local strategy for authentication.
Sets up an Express router for handling routes.
Routes:
Home Page: Renders the home page (index.ejs).
Admin Page: Fetches all user data from the database and sends it as a response.
Profile Page:
Renders the profile page (profile.ejs) with user information if the user is logged in.
Handles image uploads for the user's profile, updating the database with the uploaded image filenames.
Sign Up and Login:
Renders sign-up and login pages (sign_in.ejs and login.ejs).
Handles user registration and login using Passport's local strategy.
Logout: Logs the user out and redirects to the home page.
Authentication and Authorization:
Uses a middleware function isLogged to check if a user is logged in before allowing access to certain routes (e.g., the profile page).
Image Upload:
Utilizes Multer for handling image uploads in the profile upload route.
Stores uploaded images in an uploads/ directory and updates the user's profile with the image filenames.
Error Handling:
Includes try-catch blocks for handling errors during database operations and file uploads.
Environment Variables:
Uses the dotenv module to load environment variables from a .env file, which is a common practice for managing sensitive information like database credentials.
